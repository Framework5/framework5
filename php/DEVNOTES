Framework5 is a lightweight object oriented framework designed for rapid application development



Need to make heavy use of Singleton design pattern
	create an abstract singleton class
	classes that could be singletons
		- Database
		- 
		
		
Execution Timer


Factory extends Singleton (abstract)

Need to find a way to make classes (ex Database) callable only from the factory
	declare classes as final?


Should Factory->instances be blocked passed Framework?




Consider making more static methods

TODO Implement namespaces


TODO test require_once vs class_exists('myClass') || require('path/to/myClass.class.php');

Re-structure directories. ex:
	/framework/app/controllers
	/framework/core/controllers
	
	
Create setting to allow controllers to be imported more than once, without throwing error
